# ## Constraints
# 
# * Does foo do anything else?
#     * No

# ## Test Cases
# 
# * foo(val) -> val

# ## Algorithm
# 
# Refer to the [Solution Notebook]().  If you are stuck and need a hint, the solution notebook's algorithm discussion might be a good place to start.

# ## Code

# In[ ]:


def foo(val):
    # TODO: Implement me
    pass


# ## Unit Test

# **The following unit test is expected to fail until you solve the challenge.**

# In[ ]:


get_ipython().run_line_magic('load', 'test_foo.py')


# ## Solution Notebook
# 
# Review the [Solution Notebook]() for a discussion on algorithms and code solutions.
