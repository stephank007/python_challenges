# # Solution Notebook

# ## Problem: Flip one bit from 0 to 1 to maximize the longest sequence of 1s.
# 
# * [Constraints](#Constraints)
# * [Test Cases](#Test-Cases)

# * [Unit Test](#Unit-Test)

# ## Constraints
# 
# * Is the input an int, base 2?
#     * Yes
# * Can we assume the input is a 32 bit number?
#     * Yes
# * Do we have to validate the length of the input?
#     * No
# * Is the output an int?
#     * Yes
# * Can we assume the inputs are valid?
#     * No
# * Can we assume we are using a positive number since Python doesn't have an >>> operator?
#     * Yes
# * Can we assume this fits memory?
#     * Yes

# ## Test Cases
# 
# * None -> Exception
# * All 1's -> Count of 1s
# * All 0's -> 1
# * General case
#     * Trailing zeroes
#         * 0000 1111 1101 1101 1111 0011 1111 0000 -> 10 (ten)
#     * Trailing ones
#         * 0000 1001 1101 1101 1111 0001 1111 0111 -> 9

# ## Algorithm
# 
# * seen = []
# * Build a list of sequence counts
#     * Look for 0's
#         * This will be 0 length if the input has trailing ones
#         * Add sequence length to seen
#     * Look for 1's
#         * Add sequence length to seen
# * Find the largest sequence of ones looking at seen
#     * Loop through seen
#         * On each iteration of the loop, flip what we are looking for from 0 to 1 and vice versa
#         * If seen[i] represents 1's, continue, we only want to process 0's
#         * If this is our first iteration:
#             * max_result = seen[i+1] + 1 if seen[i] > 0
#             * continue
#         * If we are looking at leading zeroes (i == len(seen)-1):
#             * result = seen[i-1] + 1
#         * If we are looking at one zero:
#             * result = seen[i+1] + seen[i-1] + 1
#         * If we are looking at multiple zeroes:
#             * result = max(seen[i+1], seen[i-1]) + 1
#         * Update max_result based on result
# 
# We should make a note that Python does not have a logical right shift operator built in.  We can either use a positive number or implement one for a 32 bit number:
# 
#     num % 0x100000000 >> n
#     
# Complexity:
# * Time: O(b)
# * Space: O(b)
